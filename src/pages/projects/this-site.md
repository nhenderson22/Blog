## Why?
Ive always wanted my own website. It looks professional, and its a place where I can voice my opinions. So I decided to make this website.
## Design Decisions
I learned a lot as I did research on how to best make this website. I knew that there had to be a better option for creating a website where so much code would be reused. This led me to things called static site generator. A static site generator is simply a programatic way of generating html files to serve up in a website. I liked this method of doing things as it shipped no javascript by default (this is generally a plus for me and ive ranted about this before). This led me to choose astro as it uses the modern paradigm of ui desing with jsx components. This meant I was able to write components like I normally would with something like rect. So with a modern paradigm and generally a better way of serving up programs I chose astro
## Deployment
Deployment is very easy with astro as it just creates a bunch of static pages. So you can use something like nginx or if youre poor like me you use netlify that has a free tier and even easier deployment. S
