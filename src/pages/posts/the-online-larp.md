## The Modern Internet
The modern internet has morphed into a beast that I dont particularly like. Freckled with social media companies trying to steal your time, so called "influencers" leveraging a hopless society for profit, or those trying to make the world a worse place. These trends scare me in a way that I dont particularly like and It seems that we will all have to deal with the consequences.
## Leveraging The Dejected Masses
The thing that scares me the most whilst I am forced to navigate the modern web is the growing reliance of the average person on the internet and those that post to it. This manifests itself in odd parasocial relation ships where people think that these psuedo celebrities are their friends. Needless to say this relationship is a dangerous one as it can be and is wielded to the detrement of those that fall victim to it. This can look like any number of things but the thing that annoys me the most is the forming small armies that can be used to do any number of things. On surface level this only seems a little bit odd but these online armies then get used to harass others all under the guise of helping their friend. I don't know what led to such a trend but it is one that is undoubtely a symptom of the atomized society in the west. I hope for the sake of the average person we can find solutions to these problems but it feels to me like yelling into the void.
## Its too Corporate Now
This is a slight gripe of mine. I just hate not being able to go on the internet without being marketed to. I need to jump through an insane amount of hoops to keep a semblance of sanity and it is annoying. I don't really have a point here I just hate it.
