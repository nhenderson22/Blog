## My first Arch Install
I decided to swith to Arch for one reason, I hate bloat. I hate when my sytem has things on it that I dont want there, and I hate having to build down to a system I like. This is why I decided to swith to Arch as it is a distro that truly lets me do anything I want. This is great for crafting a workflow that I like and I cant wait to get tinkering!
## Future Goals for Arch
As it stands at the moment I am using the Gnome Desktop Environment. While Gnome isnt bad I want to move to something that I build myself. I am eventually going to switch to a tiling window manager. However there is so much stuff I want to learn right now I am going to wait until things calm down before I spend the time to craft a beautiful system that I like. At that point Ill do a fresh install with everyting I truly want and nothing I dont.
## What am I doing before my Goals
I told myself that I was going to truly learn Emacs for that sweet sweet org mode so that Is my next endeavour in the linux space. Emacs appeals to me for many reasons the main one being LSP mode and org mode. So hopefullly I will have time to learn after I get some more projects out, at least thats the plan.
